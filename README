       CPAN::Module::Resolver - Resolve module names to the dists they are

       There are many ways to resolve what package a module is contained in,
       and this is a primary feature of any CPAN Client.

       This module simply aims to unify all the different ways of doing it via
       one simple interface:

               use CPAN::Module::Resolver;

               my $resolver = CPAN::Module::Resolver->new();
               my $result   = $resolver->resolve('Moose');

               for my $uri ( @{ $result->{uris} } ){
                       print "$uri\n";
               }

       And this does a many things automatically to make life easier:

       ·   Automatically chooses from all available HTTP Methods, presently
           consisting of

           ·     LWP

           ·     wget

           ·     curl

           ·     HTTP::Tiny

       ·   Automatically uses available web services to query the results,
           using one of

           ·     cpanmetadb

           ·     metacpan api

           ·     searching search.cpan.org

       And additionally, you can choose which HTTP backend to use, and which
       query interface to call.

               my $resolver = CPAN::Module::Resolver->new(
                       backend_http_order    => [qw( LWP wget curl fake )],                                            # uses the first one that works
                       backend_resolve_order => [qw( metacpan cpanmetadb search_cpan_org )],           # uses first successful result.
               );

       Most the code at present is stolen from bits of the ever popular
       "cpanm"
